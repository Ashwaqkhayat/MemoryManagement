# MemoryManagement
Operating Systems Project - Main Memory implementation usign Java PL

Memory management is an operating system functionality that manages memory and transfers processes back and forth between the main memory and disk during program execution (OS Memory Management, n.d.). Our projectâ€™s idea is to implement a simulation of two kinds of memory used in computers which are the Main memory & Virtual memory, and their management of process allocation.
